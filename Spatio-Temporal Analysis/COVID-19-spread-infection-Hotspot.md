# Spatio-temporal variation of COVID-19 spread focusing on infection Hotspot
** Spatio-Temporal Data Analysis class(prof. Jaewoo Park) Term project



As the COVID-19 virus becomes a global pandemic, it is an important issue to look at the spread of the virus.  Especially COVID-19 is highly contagious compared to other viruses, people are frequently infected simultaneously in a specific case such as hospital case, Sinchunji church and so on. I want to call this infection Hotspot in this report. Once this Hotspot occurs, the confirmed people spread quickly to the surrounding area. Therefore, I want to predict the diffusion trend and direction of COVID-19 through Hotspot analysis.

- Dataset

All data are included for this analysis (Hotspot, Confirmed, South Korea shp etc)



- Rcode

**STDA_PROJ_Make_Rdata.R** : You can make the Rdata from this code. Rdata is used in the main code.

**STDA_PROJ_function.R** : All functions which are used in the main code.

**STDA_PROJ_main.R** : You can conduct the analysis and get results from this code.
